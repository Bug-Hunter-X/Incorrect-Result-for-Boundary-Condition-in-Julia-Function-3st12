# Incorrect Result for Boundary Condition in Julia Function

This repository contains a Julia function that demonstrates an uncommon error related to boundary conditions. The function `myfunction` calculates the square of a number if it's greater than 10, otherwise it adds 1 to the number. However, when the input is exactly 10, the function does not return the expected result. The bug is that the code does not correctly handle the boundary condition when the input is 10. It should be fixed to explicitly handle the case where the input is 10.

The solution shows how to handle the boundary condition properly, ensuring the function returns the correct output for all input values.
